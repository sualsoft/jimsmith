### We Value Safety

Your health and our team’s health are of the utmost importance to us. We’re keeping close tabs on COVID-19 (coronavirus) announcements, developments, and precautions being taken worldwide, and we want to share the steps we are taking as an organization to address the situation and act accordingly

- Keeping the recommended 6 feet from people who are sneezing/coughing
- Cleaning frequently touched surfaces
- Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing
- If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty
- Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands
- Avoid close contact with people who are sick
- Stay home when you are sick

We encourage our customers to let us know in advance of an appointment if there are any concerns or they would like us to take special precautions. We will continue to closely monitor the situation surrounding the COVID-19 coronavirus and act accordingly.

We hope this alleviates any concerns you may have when choosing House Doctors for your handyman needs. Please contact us with any questions or concerns.
