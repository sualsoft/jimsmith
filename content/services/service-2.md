Install, Clean, Replace & More
The attic is out of sight yet important when it comes to energy efficiency, indoor air quality and roof integrity. There are five types of projects that keep attics in good condition and save money by preventing much more expensive repairs down the line. Mr. Handyman believes in a convenient, one-call solution where one simple call schedules an appointment and delivers a safe, worry-free experience completed by a professional.

Attic Stairs & Attic Door Installation
The attic is not always an easy room to access. If you’re tired of getting out the ladder, talk to your local Mr. Handyman about installing drop down stairs so that you can easily use your attic space for storage and more. Our home improvement professionals can also repair unsightly attic doors or install new attic doors altogether.

Attic Insulation
We check insulation level and quality, make recommendations and install many kinds of insulation to keep you up to code and in the pink when the weather turns hot or cold. We don’t want your air conditioner and heater to work overtime if they don’t have to.

Mold Prevention
Your roof and your attic’s ceiling are one and the same. If your attic has cracks and holes, then moisture from the outside will create mold, mildew and wood rot. Preventative maintenance and addressing signs of trouble early is simply money in the pocket.

Structural Integrity
If there are any signs of leaking, such as stains on your ceiling or water damage high on walls, we inspect attic areas for water damage and replace lumber quickly and professionally, preventing the need for costly roof repairs. Our home improvement professionals can also install hurricane straps/ties/clips on all roof trusses that attached to the wall frame in order to prevent lift from the roof in extreme wind events.

Vent Cleaning & Attic Fan Installation
Attic and roof vents that are clean allow air to flow through the attic, and similarly, attic fans help attic circulation, keeping your attic dry, your air fresh and your home cool in the summer heat. Please note that electrical services are subject to state and local licensing requirement and therefore may not be available at all locations. Contact your local Mr. Handyman for more information.
